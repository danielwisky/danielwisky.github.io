Social buttons (rendered in the footer) are great for having a small hub with all your social footprint.
In order to change them, go to _config.yml and edit the social list:

<pre style="text-align: left">
social:
  - title: "github"
    url: "https://github.com/"
  - title: "linkedin"
    url: "http://no.linkedin.com/"
  - title: "youtube"
    url: "http://youtube.com/"
  - title: "rss"
    url: "/feed.xml"
</pre>

There are plenty of social networks, just try them out and see its rendering in the browser ðŸ˜‰
